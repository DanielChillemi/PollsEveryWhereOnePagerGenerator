# S.A.F.E. D.R.Y. A.R.C.H.I.T.E.C.T. System Documentation

## Purpose
This document outlines the architectural and development principles being followed in the PollsEveryWhere One Pager Generator project. It serves as a reference guide and does not override existing Jira tickets, team assignments, or established workflows.

## Integration with Existing Workflow
- **Jira Integration**: All tasks are still managed through Jira
- **Team Assignments**: Existing team member responsibilities remain unchanged
- **Code Review Process**: Standard review process remains in place
- **Documentation**: Supplements existing documentation without replacing it

## Core Principles
[Previous BUILD_PROMPT content from constants.ts]

## Current Project Status
- Authentication system is implemented
- Brand Kit Management is handled by dedicated team
- Mock data implementation is in place while waiting for Vercel deployment
- Development continues based on Jira ticket priorities

## How to Use This Guide
1. Reference these principles when making architectural decisions
2. Use as supplementary documentation alongside existing specs
3. Follow team leads' guidance on implementation priorities
4. Refer to Jira for actual task tracking and assignments

## Note to Team Members
This architectural guide is meant to support, not replace, our existing development process. Always:
1. Follow your assigned Jira tickets
2. Coordinate with your team lead
3. Use established code review processes
4. Reference primary documentation first
