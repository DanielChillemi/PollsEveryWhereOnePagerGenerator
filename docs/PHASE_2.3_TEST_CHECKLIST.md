### 6. Expected Results

**Success** ✅:
- Loading spinner appears
- Status: "Generating wireframe structure..."
- No 400 Bad Request error
- Backend creates one-pager successfully
- Navigates to `/onepager/:id` (will show 404 - that's expected until Task 5)

**Backend logs should show**:

```

## 🐛 If Something Fails

### Target Audience Dropdown Not Showing
**Check console for**:
- "Rendering target audience input (no audiences found)" ← BAD
- "Rendering target audience dropdown with: [...]" ← GOOD

**If still showing input**:
- Check: `targetAudiences` state in console
- Check: `brandKit.target_audiences` has data
- Verify transformation applied: `brandKit.id` should exist

### 400 Bad Request Still Happening
**Check Network tab**:
1. Click failed `/onepagers` request
2. View "Payload" tab
3. Check `brand_kit_id` value
4. Should be: `"68e5ad37c77c94fcf5b8aa8b"` (24 chars)
5. Should NOT be: `undefined`, `null`, or `""`

**Check backend error**:
- View "Response" tab
- Note the exact error message
- Share if still having issues

---

## ✅ Expected Final State

After successful submission:

1. **URL changes**: `/onepager/create` → `/onepager/{some_id}`
2. **Page shows**: 404 Not Found (expected - Task 5 not built yet)
3. **Console shows**: Successful creation with ID
4. **Backend logs**: `201 Created`
5. **Database**: New document in `onepagers` collection
