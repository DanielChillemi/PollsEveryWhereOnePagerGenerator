   - Upload brand guidelines and assets
   - Configure brand colors, fonts, and style preferences
   - Set up project templates for common use cases

2. **Brand Configuration**

     logo:
       url: "/assets/brand/poll-everywhere-logo.svg"
       variations: ["primary", "white", "monochrome"]
   ```

3. **Template Library Setup**
   - Industry-specific templates (SaaS, Healthcare, Finance, etc.)
   - Use case templates (Product launch, Sales enablement, Trade show)
   - Audience templates (C-level, IT decision makers, End users)

### Poll Everywhere Brand Guidelines

This tool is built with the **Poll Everywhere Design System v2.0**, ensuring all generated materials maintain brand consistency.

#### **Design Principles**
- ✓ **Clean & Modern**: Embrace white space for a professional, uncluttered aesthetic
- ✓ **Gradient-Forward**: Use the signature purple-to-blue gradient for primary CTAs and hero elements
- ✓ **Rounded & Friendly**: Fully rounded buttons (50px) and smooth corners (8-12px) create an approachable feel
- ✓ **Typography-Driven**: Source Sans Pro at 18px for body text ensures readability and brand recognition
- ✓ **Consistent Spacing**: 8px base unit system creates visual rhythm and hierarchy

#### **Brand Elements to Maintain**
1. **Color Usage**
   - Primary actions use gradient: `linear-gradient(135deg, #864CBD 0%, #1568B8 100%)`
   - Links and secondary actions use Primary Blue (#007ACC)
   - Headlines use Text Dark (#1a1a1a) for maximum contrast
   - Body copy uses standard Text (#333333) for comfortable reading

2. **Typography Hierarchy**
   - H1 Hero: 48px Bold (page titles, hero headlines)
   - H2 Section: 32px Bold (major section dividers)
   - H3 Subsection: 24px Semibold (card titles, subsections)
   - Body Text: 18px Normal (paragraphs, descriptions)
   - Small Text: 14px Normal (captions, fine print)

3. **Button Styles**
   - **Primary (Gradient)**: For main CTAs ("Get Started", "Sign Up")
   - **Secondary (Solid Blue)**: For secondary actions ("Learn More", "View Details")
   - **Outline**: For tertiary actions ("Contact Sales", "Download")
   - All buttons use 50px border-radius for consistent rounding

4. **Stats & Numbers**
   - Use 56px Bold in Primary Blue for impressive statistics
   - Example: "10m+ Presenters Empowered", "200m+ Participants Engaged"
   - Center-align with light gray labels below

#### **Brand DON'Ts**
- ✗ Don't use sharp corners or boxy designs
- ✗ Don't overcrowd elements - always maintain generous white space
- ✗ Don't use colors outside the defined palette
- ✗ Don't mix other font families with Source Sans Pro
- ✗ Don't create busy or cluttered layouts
