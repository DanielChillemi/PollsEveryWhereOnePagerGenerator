# Delete Functionality Implementation Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-08  
**Feature:** Delete one-pagers from dashboard  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

---

## Overview

Added the ability for users to delete one-pagers directly from the dashboard. Each one-pager card now has a delete button (üóëÔ∏è trash icon) that allows users to permanently remove unwanted one-pagers.

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. Backend API Endpoint ‚úÖ

**Already Existed:** `DELETE /api/v1/onepagers/{onepager_id}`

**Location:** `backend/onepagers/routes.py` (lines 418-474)

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Validates ObjectId format
- ‚úÖ Verifies ownership (403 if not owner)
- ‚úÖ Returns 404 if not found
- ‚úÖ Hard delete from database
- ‚úÖ Returns 204 No Content on success

**Usage:**
```python
@router.delete(
    "/{onepager_id}",
    status_code=status.HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT
)
async def delete_onepager(onepager_id: str, current_user: UserInDB, db):
    # Validates ownership and deletes
    await db.onepagers.delete_one({"_id": ObjectId(onepager_id)})
    return None
```

---

### 2. Frontend Hook: `useOnePagerDelete`

**Created:** `frontend/src/hooks/useOnePagerDelete.ts`

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ React Query mutation hook
- ‚úÖ Calls DELETE endpoint with auth token
- ‚úÖ Invalidates one-pagers list query (refreshes dashboard)
- ‚úÖ Removes specific one-pager from cache
- ‚úÖ Error handling with 401 redirect to login
- ‚úÖ Loading states (isPending, isSuccess, error)

**Hook API:**
```typescript
const { deleteOnePager, isPending, error, isSuccess } = useOnePagerDelete()

// Usage
await deleteOnePager(onePagerId)  // Returns Promise<void>
```

**Cache Management:**
```typescript
onSuccess: (_, deletedId) => {
  // Refresh dashboard list
  queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['onepagers'] })
  
  // Remove from cache
  queryClient.removeQueries({ queryKey: ['onepagers', deletedId] })
}
```

---

### 3. Dashboard UI Updates

**Updated:** `frontend/src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx`

**Added Components:**
1. **Delete Button** - Trash icon (üóëÔ∏è) on each one-pager card
2. **Confirmation Dialog** - Browser confirm dialog before deletion
3. **Loading State** - Shows loading spinner on delete button during deletion
4. **Event Handling** - Prevents card navigation when clicking delete

**UI Changes:**

**Before:**
```tsx
<HStack justify="space-between">
  <Badge>{status}</Badge>
  {has_brand_kit && <Text>üé® Branded</Text>}
</HStack>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<HStack justify="space-between">
  <HStack>
    <Badge>{status}</Badge>
    {has_brand_kit && <Text>üé® Branded</Text>}
  </HStack>
  <IconButton
    aria-label="Delete one-pager"
    onClick={(e) => handleDelete(e, id, title)}
    loading={deletingId === id}
  >
    üóëÔ∏è
  </IconButton>
</HStack>
```

**Delete Handler:**
```typescript
const handleDelete = async (e: React.MouseEvent, onePagerId: string, title: string) => {
  e.stopPropagation() // Don't navigate to canvas
  
  const confirmed = window.confirm(
    `Are you sure you want to delete "${title}"?\n\nThis action cannot be undone.`
  )
  
  if (!confirmed) return
  
  try {
    setDeletingId(onePagerId)
    await deleteOnePager(onePagerId)
    // Success - dashboard auto-refreshes via query invalidation
  } catch (error) {
    alert('Failed to delete one-pager. Please try again.')
  } finally {
    setDeletingId(null)
  }
}
```

## User Experience Flow

### Happy Path ‚ú®
```
1. User views dashboard with one-pager cards
2. User clicks delete button (üóëÔ∏è) on unwanted one-pager
3. Confirmation dialog appears: "Are you sure you want to delete [title]?"
4. User clicks "OK"
5. Delete button shows loading spinner
6. One-pager is deleted from backend
7. Dashboard automatically refreshes (card disappears)
8. Success! ‚úÖ
```

### Cancel Flow
```
1. User clicks delete button (üóëÔ∏è)
2. Confirmation dialog appears
3. User clicks "Cancel"
4. Dialog closes, nothing happens ‚úÖ
```

### Error Handling
```
1. User clicks delete button
2. Confirms deletion
3. Network error or server error occurs
4. Alert shows: "Failed to delete one-pager. Please try again."
5. Card remains visible (no changes)
6. User can retry ‚úÖ
```

## Technical Features

### 1. **Optimistic UI Update**
- Card removal is instant after successful deletion
- React Query automatically invalidates and refetches the list
- No manual state management needed

### 2. **Cache Management**
- Invalidates `['onepagers']` query ‚Üí Refreshes dashboard
- Removes `['onepagers', deletedId]` ‚Üí Cleans up detail cache
- Ensures consistency across all components

### 3. **Event Bubbling Prevention**
```typescript
onClick={(e) => {
  e.stopPropagation() // Prevents card click navigation
  handleDelete(e, id, title)
}}
```

### 4. **Loading States**
- `deletingId` state tracks which card is being deleted
- Shows loading spinner on active delete button
- Disables button during deletion to prevent double-clicks

### 5. **Confirmation Dialog**
- Native `window.confirm()` for simplicity
- Shows one-pager title for clarity
- Warns "This action cannot be undone"

## Security Considerations

### Backend Security ‚úÖ
1. **Authentication Required** - JWT token verified
2. **Ownership Verification** - Users can only delete their own one-pagers
3. **404 for Not Found** - No information leakage
4. **403 for Unauthorized** - Clear permission error

### Frontend Security ‚úÖ
1. **Token Management** - Auth token from localStorage
2. **401 Redirect** - Redirects to login if token invalid
3. **No Soft Delete** - Hard delete (immediate removal from DB)
4. **User Confirmation** - Prevents accidental deletions
