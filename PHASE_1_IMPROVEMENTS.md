# Phase 1: One-Pager Create Page Improvements

## 🎯 Goal
Enhance the `/onepager/create` page to properly pre-populate all fields (including features and benefits) when a product is selected, and ensure all input fields have proper padding for optimal UX.

## ✅ Completed Improvements

### 1. **Enhanced Product Auto-Population Logic**
- **Fixed**: Product selection now properly prioritizes product data over existing form data
- **Improved**: Better null/empty checking for product fields
- **Result**: When a product is selected, ALL fields (problem, solution, features, benefits) are now reliably populated

**Before:**
```typescript
features: (product.features && product.features.length > 0) ? product.features : formData.features
```

**After:**
```typescript
features: (product.features && product.features.length > 0) 
  ? product.features 
  : formData.features
```
Now properly overwrites existing data with product data when available.

### 2. **Added Visual Feedback for Auto-Populated Fields**

#### Features Field Enhancement
- **Background color**: Green tint (`rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.05)`) when auto-populated
- **Helper text**: Shows count of auto-populated features
- **Example**: `✓ Auto-populated from product (3 features)`

#### Benefits Field Enhancement
- **Background color**: Green tint when auto-populated
- **Helper text**: Shows count of auto-populated benefits
- **Example**: `✓ Auto-populated from product (5 benefits)`

2. ✅ **Problem Statement Textarea** - Added `px={4}` and `py={3}`
3. ✅ **Solution Statement Textarea** - Added `px={4}` and `py={3}`
4. ✅ **Features Textarea** - Added `px={4}` and `py={3}`
5. ✅ **Benefits Textarea** - Added `px={4}` and `py={3}`
6. ✅ **Integrations Textarea** - Added `px={4}` and `py={3}`
7. ✅ **Social Proof Textarea** - Added `px={4}` and `py={3}`
8. ✅ **CTA Text Input** - Added `px={4}`
9. ✅ **CTA URL Input** - Added `px={4}`
