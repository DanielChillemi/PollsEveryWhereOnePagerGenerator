## üêõ Known Issues to Watch For

### Potential Problems

1. **Auth Redirect** - If not logged in, you'll be redirected to `/login`
   - Solution: Create account or log in first

2. **TypeScript Errors** - If you see console errors about types
   - Check browser console (F12)
   - Report any type mismatches

3. **Chakra UI v3 Warnings** - Some components might have deprecation warnings
   - Note which components show warnings
   - Check if functionality still works

4. **Selection Not Working** - If elements don't highlight on click
   - Check console for onClick handler errors
   - Verify canvasStore is updating

5. **Mode Toggle Not Switching** - If wireframe/styled doesn't change
   - Check Switch component in toolbar
   - Verify canvasStore mode is updating

6. **Zoom Not Working** - If +/- buttons don't change scale
   - Check transform CSS is being applied
   - Verify zoom value updates in store

---

## üìä Performance Testing

### Metrics to Monitor

- [ ] **Initial Load Time** - Page should load in < 1 second
- [ ] **Mode Toggle Speed** - Should be instant (< 100ms)
- [ ] **Zoom Response** - Should be smooth, no lag
- [ ] **Element Selection** - Instant highlight on click
- [ ] **Scroll Performance** - Smooth scrolling, no jank

### Browser Console

Open Dev Tools (F12) and check:

- **Console Tab** - No errors (warnings okay)
- **Network Tab** - All assets load successfully
- **Performance Tab** - No long tasks or janky frames

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Manual Testing Notes

### What to Test

1. **Load each mock data set** and verify visual rendering
2. **Toggle between modes** multiple times (wireframe ‚Üî styled)
3. **Zoom in and out** to extremes (50%, 200%)
4. **Click every element** to test selection
5. **Scroll the canvas** up and down
6. **Resize browser window** to test responsiveness

### What to Document

For each test, note:
- ‚úÖ **Pass** - Works as expected
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning** - Works but has minor issues
- ‚ùå **Fail** - Does not work, blocks testing

**Example**:
```
‚úÖ Mode Toggle - Works perfectly, instant switch
‚ö†Ô∏è Image Element - Loads but placeholder is slow
‚ùå Zoom to 200% - Canvas overflows container
```

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

Phase 2.2A is successful if:

- ‚úÖ All 9 element types render visibly
- ‚úÖ Mode toggle switches styling (wireframe ‚Üî styled)
- ‚úÖ Zoom controls adjust canvas scale (50%-200%)
- ‚úÖ Element selection highlights with blue outline
- ‚úÖ No blocking TypeScript or runtime errors
- ‚úÖ Toolbar stays fixed during scroll
- ‚úÖ Debug panel updates correctly
- ‚úÖ Performance is acceptable (no major lag)

npm run lint        # Check for lint errors
```

### Can't Access /canvas-test

1. Make sure you're logged in
2. Navigate to http://localhost:5173/canvas-test

## üéì Learning Points

### For Marketing Teams

- **Wireframe Mode** = Structure and content validation (grayscale)
- **Styled Mode** = Brand application and visual design (colors)
- **Element Selection** = Click to focus and edit (future feature)
- **Zoom** = Detail work vs. overview perspective

### For Developers

- **Type-Safe State** = Zustand stores with TypeScript interfaces
- **Component Composition** = ElementRenderer dispatches to specific components
- **CSS-in-JS** = Chakra UI v3 with dynamic styling
- **Error Boundaries** = Graceful failure handling with retry
